Anno Domini 1086. By decree of William, King of England and Duke of Normandy, who by God's grace claimed victory over Harold Godwinson at Hastings, a great survey of the realm is commanded. As a royal legatus in service to His Majesty's court, you have been tasked with documenting the feudal bonds of England's noble houses.

Before you lie numerous parchments recording fealty oaths between the dukes of the realm. Each record speaks of one duke swearing homage to another, binding their houses in vassalage. His Majesty requires knowledge of how many independent ducal houses remain in his domain, that he might better understand the division of power in his conquered lands.

You must examine these records of fealty and determine the number of distinct ducal hierarchies within the realm. May God and His Majesty guide your calculations.
